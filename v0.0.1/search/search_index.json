ASP.NET Core offers a flexible configuration system that enables developers to manage application settings from a variety of sources, such as JSON files (like appsettings.json), environment variables, command-line arguments, secrets managers, and more. These configuration sources are automatically combined into a single, hierarchical configuration object that the application can use throughout its lifecycle.</p> <p>One of the key characteristics of ASP.NET Core\u2019s configuration system is its built-in support for environment-specific configurations. Developers can create environment-specific files like appsettings.Development.json, appsettings.Staging.json, or appsettings.Production.json, which override settings from the base configuration file. Additionally, environment variables or command-line arguments can further override any configuration values at runtime. This layered approach makes it easy to manage settings for different deployment environments, enabling a clear separation of concerns and promoting safe and consistent deployment practices.</p>"},{"location":"configuration/#configuration-files","title":"Configuration files","text":"<p>In the service we have opted for an approach that splits configuration properties in different configuration files depending on the application behavior they affect.</p> <ul> <li>accounting.json: Controls how accounting information is generated</li> <li>cache.json: Controls which mechanisms will be used for caching</li> <li>conversation.json: Controls the behavior of the Conversation feature</li> <li>cors.json: Controls CORS policies</li> <li>db.json: Controls the database connection</li> <li>errors.json: Vocabulary of error codes</li> <li>formatting.json: Controls how formatting of common datatypes is performed</li> <li>forwarded-headers.json: Controls the discovery of forwarded HTTP headers</li> <li>health-check.json: Controls the health check behavior</li> <li>idp.claims.json: Controls the extraction of known JWT claims</li> <li>idp.client.json: Controls the access of the service to the configured OIDC identity provider</li> <li>localization.json: Controls the localization behavior</li> <li>log-tracking.json: Controls the log correlation and log enrichment behavior</li> <li>logging.json: Controls the logging configuration</li> <li>open-api.json: Controls the OpenAPI specification generation</li> <li>permissions.json: Controls the authorization grants</li> <li>service-airflow.json: Controls the integation with the underpinning Airflow service</li> <li>service-cross-dataset-discovery.json: Controlls the integration with the underpinning Cross Dataset Discovery service</li> <li>service-data-management.json: Controlls the integration with the underpinning Data Management service</li> <li>service-in-data-exploration.json:  Controlls the integration with the underpinning In Data Exploration service</li> <li>user-collection.json: Controls the behavior of the Conversation feature</li> <li>vocabulary.json: Vocabularies used for model management</li> </ul>"},{"location":"configuration/#environment-overrides","title":"Environment Overrides","text":"<p>To facilitate configuring the service for different environments and allow reuse of overriding values, the service has a configuration substitution enabled tha tallows defining overriding keys to be used in various configuration values.</p> <p>For example, in idp.client.json the Idp:Client:Authority configuration option value is set to \"%{IdpAuthority}%\".

An example is a User Collection that is owned by a specific user</li> <li>Claim: a policy similar to the Context-less permission assignment. Instead of checking specificaly the \"role\" claim type, this policy will check ad-hoc claims that have specific values to match the policy</li> <li>Client: a policy similar to the Context-less permission assignment. Instead of checking specificaly the \"role\" claim type, this policy will check the caller client id to have a specific value to match the policy</li> <li>Authenticated: Authenticated user, regardless of any other characteristic vcan be granted or not granted the specific permission</li> <li>Anonymous: Anonymous users be be granted or not granted the specific permission</li> </ul> <p>For context based authorization policies with a Dataset affiliation bearer, the evaluation of the kind of operations that the user can perfomr is done by interpreting the respective JWT \"datasets\" claim. The context is provided through the interpretation of the context grant model detailed in the DataGEMS AAI.</p> <p>For each of affiliation bearing datasets, the following actions (verbs) are interpreted to grant needed access: * browse - Grants permission to browse the dataset in a listing view and see dataset metadata * delete - Grants permission to delete the dataset * download - Grants permission to download the dataset * edit - Grants permission to edit dataset data and metadata * search - Grants permission to perform a search using the data and metadata of the dataset. This does not refer to listing / browsing operations but advanced search capabilities offered by DataGEMS</p>"},{"location":"security/#token-exchange","title":"Token exchange","text":"<p>In the microservice architecture of DataGEMS and given the role of the Gateway Api in the DataGEMS archtiecture, it is expected that the service will need to invoke other services, either outside or within the request flow of an external invocation. The service  may need to perform some out of band operation or a scheduled maintenance / system task. Or, within the context of an incoming communication, invoke a third service as part of fulfilling its operation. We separate these two cases to distinguish the authentication mechanisms that are used:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Service to Service with Client Credentials: The service needs to acquire an access token that it can present to the service it is invoking. It will initiate a client credential flow, presenting it's client id and secret, along with the scope of the access token which will indicate the audience / reciever of the generated credential. The genereted access token can then be used in the HTTP request as a Bearer token in the Authorization header.</p> </li> <li> <p>Service to Service with Exchanged Credentials: The service, in the context of serving a user request needs to invoke another service. It must forward the credentials it was invoked with to continue the process flow under the scope of the original caller. It will initiate a token exchange flow, presenting it's client id and secret so that the AAI service authorizes the client to exhcnage the requested token, along with the initial access token that needs to be exchanged and the desired scope of the new access token which will indicate the audience / reciever of the generated, exchanged credential. The genereted access token can then be used in the HTTP request as a Bearer token in the Authorization header.</p> </li> </ul> <p>These two flows are supported by the DataGEMS AAI service and the needed configuration is located as the respective Configuration section describes.</p>"},{"location":"security/#secrets","title":"Secrets","text":"<p>Secrets are a special kind of configuration that requires special handling.
